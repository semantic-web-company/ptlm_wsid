# Linking tools

This package contains a set of wrappers for accessing Entity Linking (EL) tools.
They all conform to a single interface, implemented as an abstract class, so that they can
be used intercheangeably.
Each of the EL tools has to be deployed separatedly, and with a certain configuration.
